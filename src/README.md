### These project from 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu

---
While the inspiration and the tutorials from Angela Yu, for better learning and grasping the concepts, I try to write projects by myself as suggested.

In the series, we also do a lot of code challenges from different platforms (like replit and codingrooms) to learn the
concepts of the projects.

To not complicate things, I did not include the interactive coding challenges into here until day 15, where we switched to Pycharm.

To avoid vagueness, I try to comment in the code to help myself for future references.
