### These projects from 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu

---
In the series, we also do a lot of code challenges from different platforms (like replit and codingrooms) to learn the
concepts of the projects.

To not complicate things, I did not include the interactive coding challenges in here, only projects, to preserve the
basics of the projects.

To avoid vagueness, I try to comment in the code to help myself for future references.
