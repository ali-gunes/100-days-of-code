# 100-days-of-code
This is a source repo for my progress on course named 100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu
These projects are also from 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu

---
While the inspiration and the tutorials from Angela Yu, for better learning and grasping the concepts, I try to write project codes by myself as suggested.

In the series, we also do a lot of code challenges from different platforms (like replit and codingrooms) to learn the
concepts of the projects.

To not complicate things, I did not include the interactive coding challenges in here, only projects, to preserve the
basics of the projects.

To avoid vagueness, I try to comment in the code to help myself for future references.
